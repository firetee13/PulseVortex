          This is a reminder to set up automated backups for your trading data.

          **Why backups are important:**
          - Trading data has financial value
          - Historical data is irreplaceable
          - Configuration files contain custom settings

          **Suggested backup locations:**
          - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
          - Git LFS for smaller files
          - External database services
          - Institutional backup solutions

          **What to backup:**
          - \`timelapse.db\` (main database)
          - \`monitor_gui_settings.json\` (GUI settings)
          - Custom configuration files
          - Historical data exports

          Consider setting up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated backups.
